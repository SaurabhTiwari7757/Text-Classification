# Text-Classification
Text Classification using Naive Bayes Algorithm


In this project, We were able to correctly classify texts into different groups based on which category they belong using Naive Bayes Classifier.
We have used the make_pipeline for constructing a pipeline which helps to transform and train the data quick and easy. For more info: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-machine-learning-pipeline-3bba20c2352b 
We have used Tfidf vectorizer for Converting words to vectors. This will quantify the relevance of text representation by assigning more weights to relevant features and less weights to less relevant features and create a matrix of TF-IDF features.
We have plotted the graphs of confusion matrix using heatmap to understand the misclassified labels.
Next, We make prediction which is a number and we've converted it into a category. So we've predicted category on the data based on training model.
